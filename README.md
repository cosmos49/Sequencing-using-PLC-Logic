# Sequencing-using-PLC-Logic 

This repository provides examples and tutorials on implementing sequencing logic using Programmable Logic Controllers (PLCs). Sequencing is crucial in automation systems where a series of actions must occur in a specific order. This project focuses on creating, simulating, and optimizing various sequencing scenarios with PLC programming.
 
## Overview  

- **Sequencing Logic Basics**: Learn the fundamentals of sequencing logic and how it's applied in different automation scenarios.
- **PLC Programming Languages**: Examples provided in Ladder Logic, Function Block Diagram (FBD), and Structured Text (ST).
- **Simulation and Testing**: Step-by-step guides to simulate and test PLC logic using popular tools like Siemens TIA Portal and Allen-Bradley Studio 5000.
- **Real-World Applications**: Explore real-world use cases like traffic light control, conveyor systems, and batch processing.
- **Best Practices**: Tips and techniques for optimizing sequencing logic for efficiency and reliability.
